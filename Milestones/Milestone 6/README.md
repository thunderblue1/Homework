### Milestone 6 Screencast

In the video there is a part were I talk about accessibility. 
I mention making buttons big enough to see and using semantic html (Powell, 2021).
The reference at the bottom is where I last heard of these ideas.
I have read about these ideas before but I accredit the authors of the video as to why these ideas were in my screencast.
